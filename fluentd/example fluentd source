Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

@type tail: Specifies the type of input plugin to use, which in this case is tail.
@id in_tail_container_logs: Assigns a unique identifier to this input plugin.
path /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log: Specifies the path to the Docker container log files.
pos_file /fluentd/log/containers.log.pos: Specifies the file where Fluentd will store the current read position of the log files.
time_format "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L%Z": Specifies the time format used in the log files. This is important for correctly parsing the timestamps in the log data.
keep_time_key true: Specifies that the timestamp of the log entry should be preserved as a separate field in the record.
read_from_head true: Specifies that Fluentd should read logs from the beginning of the file.
tag "docker.*": Assigns a tag to the log data. In this case, the tag will match all logs with the prefix "docker." and can be used to route the logs to specific output destinations.
format json: Specifies the format of the log data. In this case, the log data is in JSON format, which Fluentd can parse and extract key-value pairs from.
