PUT command allows you to insert a new document data into Elasticsearch. Here's an example of how to use the PUT command:

PUT /my_playlist/song/6
{
 "title" : "1000 years",
 "artist" : "Christina Perri",
 "album" : "Breaking Dawn",
 "year" : 2011
}

Here's a breakdown of the components of the request:
PUT is the HTTP method used to send this request to Elasticsearch.
/my_playlist/song/6 specifies the index, type, and ID of the document to be created. In this case, the index is my_playlist, the type is song, and the ID is 6.
The request body is a JSON object that contains the fields and values of the document being created. In this case, the document has four fields: title, artist, album, and year, with their corresponding values.
When you send this request to Elasticsearch, it will create a new document with the specified ID in the my_playlist index, with the type song and the fields and values specified in the request body.
Note that if the my_playlist index or the song type does not exist in Elasticsearch, they will be automatically created when you send this request.

**************************************

To UPDATE a value, you use the same PUT command to the same document. For example, if you want to insert a new parameter, location, you could do it in the following way:

PUT /my_playlist/song/6
{
 "title" : "1000 years",
 "artist" : "Christina Perri",
 "album" : "Breaking Dawn",
 "year" : 2011,
 "location" : "London"
}

**************************************

GET command allows you to retrieve information about your data. Here's an example of how to use the GET command:

GET /my_playlist/song/6

**************************************

DELETE

DELETE command allows you to delete a specific document or an entire index in Elasticsearch. Here's an example of how to use the DELETE command:

DELETE /my_playlist/song/6
